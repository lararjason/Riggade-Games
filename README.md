# Basic_Roulette
This code is a simple betting game where players choose a color (Red, Black, or Green) and enter a bet amount. The game uses randomizeCards() to simulate the result, with Green having a 2% chance (10x payout) and Red/Black each having a 20% chance (1.5x payout). Key features include a spinning animation, dynamic result display (win/loss), and a "Play Again" button to reset the game.
